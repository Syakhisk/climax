My knowledge base, a note of how I (should) use the terminal (and other tools that revolves around it), Made mostly to help me remember what I learned. Take it sort of like a cheatsheet.

The content of this repo should be categorized into smaller section such as `shell`, `tmux`, `vim`, and so on. If it's not, I'm probably ~~too lazy to do that~~ working on something else.

## Setup and Tools
- [zsh](http://zsh.org/) (shell)
- [bash](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) (shell - mainly for scripting)
- [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) (zsh configuration framework)
- [starship](https://github.com/starship/starship) (zsh prompt)
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) (terminal multiplexer)
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) (cli fuzzy finder)
- [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) (more extensible vim)
- [lunarvim](https://github.com/lunarvim/lunarvim) (neovim IDE-like configuration layer)

## Table of Contents
